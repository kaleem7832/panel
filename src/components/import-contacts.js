        Bulk importing data is a process of loading large amounts of data into a
        database in a single operation. It is usually used to rapidly transfer
        large amounts of data from one system to another, or to quickly populate
        a database with data. Bulk import is commonly used by businesses, who
        need to quickly and efficiently move data from one system to another.
        Bulk import can also be used to quickly populate a database with data
        from a variety of sources, such as flat files, CSV files, and more.
